# Generic stuff: connection multiplexing
#
# Multiplex connections to
#   * reduce lag when logging into the same host in a second shell
#   * reduce the amount of connections that are made to prevent excessive DNS lookups
#     and to prevent getting blocked by a firewall, because it thinks we are executing a DoS attack.
#
# Name/location of sockets for connection multiplexing are configured using the ControlPath directive.
# In the ControlPath directive %C expands to a hashed value of %l_%h_%p_%r, where:
#    %l = local hostname
#    %h = remote hostname
#    %p = remote port
#    %r = remote username
# This makes sure that the ControlPath is
#   * a unique socket that is local to machine on which the sessions are created,
#     which means it works with home dirs from a shared network file system.
#     (as sockets cannot be shared by servers.)
#   * not getting to long as the hash has a fixed size not matter how long %l_%h_%p_%r was.
